            <h3>A Text based Adventure Game</h3>
            <p>
                It is a simple project developed using the concept of Swings in Java programming language.
                It contains four buttons that specify the four directions east,west,north,south.
                Along each of the directions certain action is going to take place like picking up a sword, 
                fighting with the monster, encounter with the town guard or increase the health points.
                In order for the main character to enter the town, he needs to be in ppossesion with the silver 
                ring which is obtained after  defeating the monster, else the town guard will not allow the main 
                character to enter into the town and if he tries to enter forcefully, then the town guard would hit him hard 
                resulting in the decrease in his health points. And he can defeat the monster only using a sword which 
                he would obtain after travelling in a certian direction. After defeating the monster he can take the silver ring from it.
